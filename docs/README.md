# TV Tagger

 Requires FFMPEG in PATH

## How to use:

1. Gather Files.
 - Put the Python Script, template.json, and all episodes (MKV or MP4) in the same folder.

2. Setup.
 - Update the 'Episode Outline' template.json as needed (If you need help, take a look at the examples.)

3. Run the script.
 - ```python tag.py -json Path.To.Your.Outline.json```
